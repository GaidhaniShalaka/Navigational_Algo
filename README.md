**The provided code implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path on a grid-based map. Here's a breakdown of the code:**

**Imports**:

Python
from collections import deque

This line imports the deque class from the collections module. A deque is a double-ended queue, which is efficient for adding and removing elements from both ends, making it suitable for BFS implementation.

**Function Definition:**

Python
def bfs(map_data, start_x, start_y, goal_x, goal_y):
 
This defines a function named bfs that takes the following arguments:

map_data: A 2D list representing the map. 0 indicates walkable space, 1 represents obstacles.
start_x: Starting X coordinate.
start_y: Starting Y coordinate.
goal_x: Goal X coordinate.
goal_y: Goal Y coordinate.
The function is responsible for finding the shortest path from the starting point to the goal point on the provided map.

**Setting Up the Grid:**

Python
rows = len(map_data)
cols = len(map_data[0])

directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
 
rows and cols store the dimensions (height and width) of the map retrieved from the map_data list.
directions is a list containing tuples representing the four possible directions for movement: up, down, left, and right.
Initializing Search Structures:

Python
visited = set()
parent = {}
queue = deque([(start_x, start_y)])
 
visited: A set to store all the cells that have been explored during the BFS search. This helps avoid revisiting the same cell.
parent: A dictionary to store the parent of each visited cell. This is used to reconstruct the path later.
queue: A deque object used to implement the BFS search queue. It stores the coordinates of cells to be explored next. The starting position is added to the queue initially.
BFS Algorithm:

Python
while queue:
    current_x, current_y = queue.popleft()
    if (current_x, current_y) == (goal_x, goal_y):
        break  # Goal reached

    for dx, dy in directions:
        next_x, next_y = current_x + dx, current_y + dy
        if conditions met:
            queue.append((next_x, next_y))
            visited.add((next_x, next_y))
            parent[(next_x, next_y)] = (current_x, current_y)

This loop performs the core BFS exploration:

It dequeues the next cell to explore from the queue (current_x, current_y).
If the current cell is the goal, it breaks out of the loop as the search is complete.
It iterates through all four directions (dx, dy) defined earlier.
For each direction, it calculates the coordinates of the neighboring cell (next_x, next_y).
It checks if the following conditions are met for the neighboring cell:
It's within the map boundaries (0 <= next_x < cols and 0 <= next_y < rows).
It's a walkable space (map_data[next_y][next_x] == 0).
It hasn't been visited before ((next_x, next_y) not in visited).
If all conditions are met, the neighboring cell is considered a valid candidate for further exploration:
It's added to the queue using queue.append.
It's marked as visited using visited.add.
The current cell is recorded as the parent of the neighboring cell in the parent dictionary. This helps reconstruct the path later.

**Reconstructing the Path (if found):**

Python
if (goal_x, goal_y) in parent:
    path = []
    x, y = goal_x, goal_y
    while (x, y) != (start_x, start_y):
        path.append((x, y))
        x, y = parent[(x, y)]
    path.append((start_x, start_y))
    return path[::-1]  # Reverse for start to goal order
else:
    return None  #
